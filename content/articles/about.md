Hi, my name is Fanchao. I'm a software engineer currently residing in Chrischurch, NZ.

I mostly do Java and React Native stuff at work, but I'm also keen on a broad range of geeky stuff.
You can probably sense that from the diversity of the blog posts.

Ok, why does this website look so primitive and ugly? You ask. 

I don't need to tell you my impossible design skill and how rusty of HTML/CSS I've become to be, 
and I hardly have the energy to put up a website that feeds on a git repository with automatic
deployment upon push. It might look last-century-ish but at least it's fast, clean,
without all the Javascript code mining your machine, and...responsive. You'll be surprise
how responsive a website can be if you don't do your everyday CSS tricks ðŸ¤£.

IMHO, the thing about displaying yourself through website, is that you want to show others what
**you** think is most important. Sure I can pick up the good old HTML, learn some sick and shiny 
CSS frameworks, and firing up the dusty (but loved) Gimp to pretend I know how to draw a nice figure,
all the superficial tricks you can make the website more attractive to color sensitive people,
but at the end of the day, it's the content, or knowledge, that I want to share with people. 
In the absence of a good design, the content is the true jewel. 

Oooph, so much explanation on personal taste. 

The purpose of this website, is to have something I can call my own, somewhere
to dump my illogical thoughts and junky tech/non-tech journey on.  

You are welcome to wander around the website and its [backing repository](https://gitlab.com/simophin/website).
