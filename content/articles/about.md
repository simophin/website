Hi, my name is Fanchao. I'm a software engineer currently residing in Chrischurch, NZ.

Agh. Why is this website such primitive and ugly? You ask. 

I don't need to tell you my impossible design skill and rusty HTML/CSS, I hardly 
have the energy to put up a website that feeds on a git repository with automatic
deployment upon push. It might look last-century-ish but at least it's fast, clear and
without all the Javascript code mining your machine. However, I can promise you
I'll put some effort into the overall tidiness ðŸ¤£.

The purpose of this website, is to have something I can call my own, somewhere
to dump my illogical thoughts and tech or non-tech journeys on.  

You are welcome to wander around the website and its [backing repository](https://gitlab.com/simophin/website).

You can each me by email: about at fanchao dot nz.
